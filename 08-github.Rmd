# Modify and Host Code with GitHub {#github}
In the first half of this book, you created interactive charts and maps on platforms that feature drag-and-drop tools, such as Google Sheets and Tableau Public. These platforms are great for beginners, but their pre-set tools limit your options for designing and customizing your visualizations, and they also require you to depend on their web servers to host your work.

In the second half of this book, get ready to make a big leap, and we'll help you along the way. You will learn how to copy, edit, and host code templates---meaning pre-written software instructions that create data visualizations---which you can modify. With templates, you'll learn how to make simple edits to insert your data, customize its appearance, and display it on the web on a site that you control. No prior coding experience is required, but it helps if you're *code-curious* and willing to experiment with your computer.

Code templates are similar to cookbook recipes. Imagine you're in your kitchen, looking at our favorite recipe that we've publicly shared to make brownies (yum!), which begins with these three steps: `Melt butter, Add sugar, Mix in cocoa.` Recipes are templates, meaning that you can follow them precisely, or modify them to suit your tastes. Imagine that you copy our recipe (or "fork" it, as coders say) and insert a new step: `Add walnuts`. If you also publicly share your recipe, now there will be two versions of instructions, to suit both those who strongly prefer or dislike nuts in their brownies. (We do not take sides in this deeply polarizing dispute.)

Currently, the most popular cookbook among coders is GitHub <https://github.com>, with more than 40 million users and over 100 million recipes (or "code repositories" or "repos"). You can sign up for a free account and choose to make your repos private (like Grandma's secret recipes) or public (like the ones we share below). GitHub encourages sharing *open-source code*, meaning the creator grants permission for others to freely distribute and modify it, based on the conditions of the type of license they have selected. When you create a brand-new repo, GitHub invites you to [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/). Two of the most popular open-source software licenses are the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), which is very permissive, and the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/), which mandates that any modifications be shared under the same license. The latter version is often described as a *copyleft* license that requires any derivatives of the original code to remain publicly accessible, in contrast to traditional *copyright* that favors private ownership. When you fork a copy of someone's open-source code on GitHub, look at the type of license they've chosen (if any), keep it in your version, and respect its terms.

In this chapter, we'll walk you through these basic GitHub steps:

- Fork and modify your own copy of our simple Leaflet map code template
- Host a live online version of your modified map code on the public web
- Create your own brand-new code repo to upload your code or other files

You can perform all of the basic steps in the GitHub web browser interface, which is a great start for beginners. For intermediate-level users, we'll also show you how to work more efficiently on your personal computer with tools such as GitHub Desktop and Atom Editor.

Finally, we'll discuss how to identify and fix common GitHub and code errors. All of us make mistakes and accidentally "break our code" from time to time, and it's a great way to learn how things really work (or in this case, how they don't work!)

## Fork and Edit a Simple Leaflet Map with GitHub {- #fork-leaflet}

TODO:

- simplify further the leaflet-map-simple repo
- add visuals to accompany forking section, similar to concepts in gitHub-video.Rmd text and video

This tutorial introduces the **basic steps** of working with code templates, using a simple Leaflet map code (http://leafletjs.com) and GitHub in your browser (http://github.com). You will learn how to:

- A) Fork (copy) Leaflet template to your GitHub account
- B) Publish your live map to public web with GitHub Pages
- C) Modify your map title, zoom level, starting point, and marker

Code templates help us to move beyond the limits of drag-and-drop web mapping services (such as Google MyMaps) and to create more customized visualizations on a web server that you control.  For more advanced examples, see the [Leaflet Map Templates](leaflet.html) chapter in this book. If you have problems with this tutorial, go to the [Fix Common GitHub and Code Errors](fix-code.html) chapter in this book.

#### Try it {-}
You will begin this tutorial with a simple interactive map that includes one pop-up point:
<iframe src="https://handsondataviz.github.io/leaflet-map-simple/" width="90%" height="350"></iframe>

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to modify the map, then geocode and upload more data points:
<iframe src="https://handsondataviz.github.io/leaflet-map-simple-instructor-sample/" width="90%" height="350"></iframe>

#### A) Fork (copy) Leaflet template to your GitHub account {-}
Before you begin, sign up for a free GitHub account: http://github.com

1) Right-click to open this GitHub code template in a new tab: https://github.com/handsondataviz/leaflet-map-simple

2) In the upper-right corner of the code template, sign in to your free GitHub account

3) In the upper-right corner, click Fork to copy the template (also called a code repository, or repo) into your GitHub account. The web address (URL) of the new copy in your account will follow this format:
```markdown
https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY
```

Reminder: You can only fork a GitHub repo **one time**. If needed, see how to make a second copy in the [Create a New Repo in GitHub](create-repo.html) chapter in this book.

#### B) Publish your live map to public web with GitHub Pages {-}

4) In your new copy of the code repo, click on Settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages area, select Master, and Save. This publishes your code template to a live map on a public website that you control.

5) Scroll down to GitHub Pages section again, to select and copy the link to your published web site, which will follow this format:
```markdown
https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY
```

6) Scroll up to the top, and click on your repo name to go back to its main page.

7) At the top level of your repo main page, click on README.md, and click the pencil icon to edit this file, written in easy-to-read Markdown code.

8) Delete the link to the current live site, and paste in the link to your site. Scroll down and Commit to save your edits.

9) On your repo main page, right-click on the link to your published site to open in a new tab. **Be patient** during busy periods, because your website may take up to 1 minute to appear the first time.

#### C) Modify your map title and add layer controls {-}

10) Go back to your browser tab for your code repo. Click on the index.html file (which contains the map code), and click the pencil icon to edit it.

11) Explore the map code, which contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Look for sections that begin with "EDIT" for items that you can easily change. Scroll down to Commit your changes.

12) Go to your live website browser tab and refresh the page to view your edits. **Be patient** during busy periods, when some edits may take up to 1 minute to appear.

13) To change your map title in the index.html file, click the pencil symbol (to edit) and go to lines 23-25. Replace "EDIT your map title" with your new title:
```HTML
<!-- Display the map and title with HTML division tags  -->
<div id="map-title">EDIT your map title</div>
<div id="map"></div>
```

14) To change your initial map zoom level, edit the index.html file and go to line 33. The zoom range for this map is from 1 (max zoom out) to 18 (max zoom in).
```JavaScript
// Set up initial map center and zoom level
var map = L.map('map', {
  center: [41.77, -72.69], // EDIT latitude, longitude to re-center map
  zoom: 12,  // EDIT from 1 to 18 -- decrease to zoom out, increase to zoom in
  scrollWheelZoom: false
});
```

15) TODO: REVISE to make simpler change in carto url, such as "light" to "dark" or similar; To change the default basemap, edit lines 46 and 52 to delete “.addTo(map)” from the Carto light layer, then add it to the Stamen colored terrain layer. DO NOT erase the semicolons!


17) To change one point on the map, you could edit the latitude and longitude coordinates of the single marker in lines 55-57. To find coordinates for any location and to learn more, go to http://www.latlong.net

```JavaScript
/* Display a blue point marker with pop-up text */
L.marker([41.77, -72.69]).addTo(map) // EDIT latitude, longitude to re-position marker
.bindPopup("Insert pop-up text here"); // EDIT pop-up text message
```

TODO: About hosting: This chapter describes how to use the free GitHub Pages feature to host a live version of your code on the public web. But what if this service is no longer free at some point in the future, or you decide for any reason that it's best to host your code elsewhere? One advantage of creating data visualizations with code templates like the ones featured in this book is that you can host them on *any* web server. Our templates are designed using three very common types of code: an HTML file to..., a JavaScript file to..., and a Cascasding Style Sheets (or CSS) file to... Describe abbreviations:...

## Create a New Repo and Upload Files on GitHub {- #create-repo}
TODO: Revise after testing GitHub "template" setting. Question: If I already forked one copy of a GitHub code repository, GitHub will not allow me to fork it a second time. So how do I make a second copy of a repo?

Answer: GitHub has a "one-fork" rule for good reasons, but here's a simple way for beginners to work around it, using only your web browser and any computer (such as Mac, Windows, or Chromebook).

- Create a brand-new repository on GitHub in your browser
- Download an existing code repository and unzip the folder
- Upload the contents of that folder to your new repository and Commit Changes

TODO: One of GitHub's many advantages is built-in support to quickly display open-data formats: CSV tables and GeoJSON geography. Upload a sample of each one to see how it looks....

#### Video with step-by-step tutorial {-}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hev2UcoLtfw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

1) Follow these steps if you have already forked a GitHub repository and wish to make a second copy of it. For example, imagine that you have already forked a copy of the Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets repository from <https://github.com/handsondataviz/leaflet-maps-with-google-sheets> **TO DO change repo address**

2) If you try to "fork" it again, GitHub will simply send you back to the first forked copy you already made. Clicking the "fork" button a second time is useless here.

3) Instead, go to your GitHub account and Create a New Repository. Give it a different name, and click the box to create a README.md file, then scroll down to click the Create button.

4) Go to the original repository where you wish to make a second copy, and click the Clone or Download button, and Download a zipped (compressed) file to your computer.

5) In your computer downloads folder, unzip the compressed file, typically by double-clicking it.

6) Go to the top level of your brand-new GitHub repository, and click the Upload Files button. Drag-and-drop all of the contents of the code repo you downloaded, EXCEPT the README.md file, because you have already created a new one. Click the Commit Changes button and be patient. During busy periods, a large upload may take 1 minute or more for GitHub to process.

7) When the upload is done, inspect the contents that you copied into your brand-new repository. To publish your new repo to the live web, go to Settings > GitHub Pages > select Master branch > Save. Then copy the link to your published live site and paste into your README.md file for future reference. If you need to review these last steps, see Part B: Publish section of the [Fork and Edit a Leaflet Map](fork-leaflet.html) chapter in this book.






## Work more efficiently with Atom editor and GitHub Desktop {- #atom-desktop}
TODO: REVISE outdated page: While you can do **nearly** everything in this book with GitHub in your browser, several steps will be faster and more efficient with two related free tools:

- download Atom Editor from GitHub (https://atom.io)
- download GitHub Desktop for Mac or Windows (https://desktop.github.com)

TODO: also mention GitHub features that allow collaboration, such as branches and pull requests

**UPDATE OLD INSTRUCTIONS**

Download the free GitHub Desktop tool to sync and  additional GitHub repos on your local Mac or Windows computer.
GitHub allows users to create one fork of the basic Searchable Map template repository. To create a second template, or to move and edit multiple files for more advanced versions, download the GitHub for Mac/Windows tool.
1. Download the free tool: [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
1. In the Searchable Map Template in GitHub, click __Clone__ and save to your hard drive
1. In your GitHub browser, create a new repository for your second template, and select options to create a README.MD and license (recommended: MIT).
1. Clone your second template repository to your hard drive
1. In your hard drive, copy and paste the files from the cloned Searchable Map Template to your cloned second template. Replace the existing README.MD and license files.
1. In your GitHub for Mac/Windows tool, __Commit and Sync__ your second template to your GitHub online account. Title the commit before clicking the button.
1. Refresh your browser to view the synced files in your GitHub account. Start at the top of these directions to remove an old gh-pages branch, create a new gh-pages branch, and edit files.

## Fix Common GitHub and Code Errors {- #fix-code}
What happens if you cannot view your published GitHub repository, or if your code breaks and no longer displays what it was designed to show? These are common problems, especially for newer students, because accidentally clicking the wrong box or mistakenly erasing a single character (such as a semicolon) can make your visualization seem to vanish, even though your work is usually still there. Breaking your code---and figuring out how to fix it---is a great way to learn, even if it requires trial and error.

#### Safely Delete your GitHub Repo and Start Over {-}
If you need to delete your GitHub repo and start over, here's a simple way to safely save your work:

- Go to the top-level of your GitHub repository, similar to `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY`
- Click the green "Clone or Download" button, and select Download Zip to receive a compressed folder of your repo contents on your computer.
- In your GitHub repo, click on Settings (upper-right area) and scroll down to Delete This Repository.
- To prevent accidental deletions, GitHub requires you to type in the REPOSITORY name.
- Now you can start over in one of these ways:
  - If you wish to [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages](github-pages.html), follow that tutorial again.
  - OR
  - Fork another copy of the original GitHub repository to your account. After you create your copy, if you wish to add selected files that you previously downloaded to your computer, follow directions to [Upload Code with GitHub](create-repo) in the second half of this tutorial in this book

#### Problems with Creating a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages {-}
If you followed the [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages tutorial](github-pages.html), it should have created two web links (or URLs):

- your code repository, in this format: `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY`
- your published web page, in this format: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`

Be sure to insert your GitHub username, and your GitHub repository name, in the general formats above.

These URLs are NOT case-sensitive, which means that `https://github.com/USERNAME` and `https://gitub.com/username` point to the same location.

##### My simple GitHub web page does not appear {-}
- Make sure that you are pointing to the correct URL for your published web page, in the format shown above.
- Be patient. During busy periods on GitHub, it may take up to 1 minute for new content to appear in your browser.
- Do a "hard refresh" to [bypass any saved content in your browser cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache).
  - Ctrl + F5 (most Windows-Linux browsers)
  - Command + Shift + R (Chrome or Firefox for Mac)
  - Shift + Reload button toolbar (Safari for Mac)
- Test the link to your published web page in a different browser. If you normally use Chrome, try Firefox.
- On rare occasions, the GitHub service or GitHub Pages feature may be down. Check <https://status.github.com>.

##### My simple GitHub web page does not display my iframe {-}
- If you followed the [Create a Simple Web Page with GitHub Pages tutorial](github-pages) and inserted an iframe in the README.md file, it will appear in your published web page, under these conditions:
  - Ideally, your README.md should be the ONLY file in this GitHub repository
  - Any other files in your repo (such as index.html, default.html, or index.md) will block the iframe HTML code in your README.md from being published on the web. If you accidentally selected a GitHub Pages Theme, you need to delete any extra files it created: click each file, select trash can to delete it, and commit changes.

![Screenshot: Extra files in GitHub repo will block iframe in your README](images/08-github/extra-files-block-readme-iframe.png)

#### Problems with iframes {-}

##### My iframe does not appear in my web page {-}
- Go back to the [Embed tutorials in this book](embed.html) to double-check the directions
- Items listed in your iframe (such as the URL, width, or height) should be enclosed inside straight quotation marks (single or double)
  - BROKEN iframe (missing quotation marks for width and height)
  ```
  <iframe src="https://handsondataviz.github.io/leaflet-map-simple" width=90% height=350></iframe>
  ```
  - FIXED iframe (with correct quotation marks)
  ```
  <iframe src="https://handsondataviz.github.io/leaflet-map-simple" width="90%" height="350"></iframe>
  ```
- Use only `https` (the extra 's' means 'secure'), not `http`. Some web browsers will block content if it mixes http and https resources, and some code templates in this book require https.

![Screenshot: Replace http with https](images/08-github/http-vs-https.png)

- Use only straight quotes, not curly quotes. Avoid pasting text from a word-processor into GitHub, which can accidentally carry over curly quotes. Typing directly into the GitHub editor will create straight quotes.

![Screenshot: Curly quotes versus straight quotes](images/08-github/curly-vs-straight-quotes.png)

#### Problems with Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets template {-}

##### My map does not appear {-}
1) Confirm that you have completed all of the key steps in the [Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets](leaflet-with-google-sheets) tutorial in this book, especially these:
  - Sign in to Google and File > Make a Copy of the Google Sheet to your Google Drive.
  - File > Publish your Google Sheet (Jack often forgets this key step!)
  - Copy your Google Sheet web address from top of your browser (usually ends with `...XYZ/edit#gid=0`) and paste into your `google-doc-url.js` file in your GitHub repo. Do NOT copy the *Published* web address (which usually ends with `...XYZ/pubhtml`)
  - When you paste your Google Sheet web address into `google-doc-url.js`, be careful not to erase single-quote marks or semicolon
  - Go to your live map link, which should follow this format: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`, refresh the browser, and wait at least 30 seconds.

2) Check your Google Sheet for errors:
- Do NOT rename column headers (in row 1) of any sheet, because the Leaflet Map code looks for these exact words.

![Screenshot: User accidentally renamed column headers in the Points tab](images/08-github/lmwgs-fix-column-headers.png)

- Do NOT rename row labels (in column A) of any sheet, due to the same reason above.

![Screenshot: Do not rename or delete](images/08-github/lmwgs-do-not-rename-labels.png)

- In your Points tab, DO NOT leave any blank rows

3) Confirm on GitHub Status (https://status.github.com/) that all systems are operational.

4) If you cannot find the problem, go to the top of this page to Safely Delete Your GitHub Repo and Start Over. Also, make a new copy of the Google Sheet template, give it a new name, and copy data from your old sheet using File > Paste Special > Values Only.

#### Problems with Chart.js code templates {-}

##### Chart displays old data {-}
If you upload new data to your Chart.js code template on GitHub Pages, and it does not appear in your browser after refreshing and waiting up to one minute, then GitHub Pages is probably not the cause of the problem. Instead, some browsers continue to show "old" Chart.js in the web cache. The simplest solution is to File > Quit your browser and re-open the link to your Chart.js

#### Problems with Mac Computers {-}

##### No file extensions {-}

Several tools in this book will not work properly if your Mac Finder does not display file extensions. In other words, every file should include a period followed by several letters (such as data.csv and map.geojson). If you do not see these extensions at the end of each file name, then go to Finder > Preferences > Advanced and check the box to turn them on, as show below:

![Screenshot: Checkbox to show filename extensions](images/08-github/mac-finder-filename-extensions.png)

#### Solve Problems with Browser Developer Tools {-}
Peek inside any website and view the web code under the hood with the browser developer tools.

In Chrome for Mac, go to View > Developer > Developer Tools

![](images/08-github/Chrome-developer-tools.png)

In Firefox for Mac, go to Tools > Web Developer > Inspector

![](images/08-github/Firefox-tools-inspector.png)
