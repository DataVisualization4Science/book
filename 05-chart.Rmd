# Chart Your Data {#chart}
Charts pull readers deeper into your story. Even if your data contains geographical information, sometimes a chart tells your story better than a map. But designing meaningful, interactive charts requires careful thought about how to communicate your data story with your audience. In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Practice [principles of chart design](chart-design.html). Learn to identify good charts from bad ones.
- Choose a chart type that matches your story and data format, and follow tutorials in the table below. Beginners may start with easy-to-learn tools such as [Google Sheets](chart-google-sheets.html) or [Tableau Public](tableau-public.html), then move up to more powerful tools, such as [Chart.js](chartjs.html), which require you to [Modify and Host Code Templates with GitHub](github.html) or another web host.

## Chart Design Principles {- #chart-design}
Spot the difference between good and bad charts, based on this compilation of design principles from leading experts, with citations listed below to learn more.

1) Remember the **most important principle:** Find meaningful insights in your data, and create visualizations that help you tell these stories. All of the other details below are secondary.

2) Before you begin, ask yourself: Do I really need a chart to tell this data story? Or would a table or text alone do a better job?

3) Decide if the best way to communicate with your audience is with static charts (such as images printed on paper) or interactive charts (embedded in a website, with tooltip details and source links). Most of these principles apply to both types, but [this book features tools and tutorials](chart) to create interactive charts.

4) Understand basic chart vocabulary: title, labels, horizontal x-axis and vertical y-axis, data series, tooltip, source and credits.

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 4 - Vocabulary.png)

5) Identify the [chart type](chart) that best matches your story and data format.

6) Draw visual comparisons that are easy for readers to understand, rather than confusing them (adapted from Gourley p. 19).

7) Do the math for your readers. Based on your data story, decide if you should show absolute numbers, percentages, or percent change (Wong pp. 23-25, 104-107).

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 7 - Do the math.png)

8) Order categories logically---either alphabetically, by value, or sequentially---depending on your data story (Gourley, p. 19; Wong pp. 70-71).

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 8 - Order.png)

9) For long labels, use horizontal bar charts instead of vertical column charts (Wong p. 66).

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 9 - Bar vs Column.png)

10) On bar and column charts, start the vertical y-axis at zero, and choose natural increments (Wong pp. 51-52). But line charts do not need to start at zero, and can focus on specific ranges. See also the [How to Lie with Charts](how-to-lie-with-charts) and [How to Lie with Maps](how-to-lie-with-maps) chapters in this book.

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 10 - Start with zero.png)

11) Beware of pie charts. Most readers cannot accurately estimate sizes of different slices. Consider other ways to show part-to-whole relationships, such as bar/column charts, or stacked bar/column charts (Few 2007, pp. 2-4; Wong p. 79).

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 11 - No pie chart.png)

12) If you choose to use a pie chart, then show no more than 5 slices, and places the largest slices closest to the top at 12 o'clock (Wong, pp. 74-75).

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 12 - Pie chart rules.png)

13) Words matter as much as pictures.
- Add meaningful titles, labels, and annotations to draw attention to your data story.
- Keep typography simple, and **use bold type** sparingly to highlight your key insights (Wong p. 32; Knaflic pp. 107, 111).

14) On static charts, label items directly when possible. (On interactive charts, designers may need to rely on tooltips and text.) Insert a legend in a logical place for readers (Wong, p. 56).

15) Add source credits and bylines---with links to view data tables and details---to build credibility and accountability.

16) Avoid “chart junk”--such as 3D perspective, shadows, and unnecessary ornaments---which distract readers from your data story. Never use 3D unless you are plotting three-dimensional data (Tufte p. *to come*, Wong p. 62, Knaflic p. 65).

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 16 - Avoid junk.png)

17) De-clutter charts (Knaflic pp. 91-98, 130-135).

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 17 - Declutter.png)

18) Choose colors wisely.
- Use color to logically organize your data. Avoid random colors (Wong pp. 40, 44).
- Avoid bad combinations from opposite sides of color wheel, such as red/green or yellow/blue (Wong pp. 40, 44).
- Use contrast (such as color vs gray) to call attention to your data story (Knaflic pp. 87-88)

![](images/05-chart/Chart - 18 - Colors.png)

## Scatter and Bubble Charts with Google Sheets {- #scatter-bubble-google}
Follow these tutorials to create different types scatter and bubble charts with [Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com)

#### Scatter chart {-}
Best to show relationships between two series of data. Also called an XY chart, because each point represents a coordinate value plotted along the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis.

**Try it:** This scatter chart reveals a downward slope: nations with lower fertility also tend to have higher life expectancy. But remember that a data correlation does not necessarily show causation. Float your cursor over points to view data details. However, the Google Sheet scatter chart only displays static labels for each country, rather than interactive tooltips. See alternative tools below.

<p><iframe width="626" height="387" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LJCj3RaVgaQsAZriV_JDQhBrIBSvnH_N1LBCkZK1bqs/pubchart?oid=386475448&amp;format=interactive"></iframe><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LJCj3RaVgaQsAZriV_JDQhBrIBSvnH_N1LBCkZK1bqs/edit#gid=562477420">View source data from World Bank</a></p>

**Tutorial:**

- Begin by opening this link in a new tab: [Google Sheets Scatter chart with static data labels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LJCj3RaVgaQsAZriV_JDQhBrIBSvnH_N1LBCkZK1bqs/)
- Follow most of the same steps in first tutorial above.
- Format your data in a similar way as shown below. The first column (life expectancy) is the x-axis data series, and the second column  (fertility) is the y-axis data series. The third column consists of data labels (names of countries).<br>
![Scatter chart table data](images/05-chart/scatter-chart-data.png)
- In the Chart Editor > Recommendations tab, choose Scatter chart, or see more options in Chart Types tab.
- To display static labels for each point, click the upper-right charter corner for Advanced Editing tools > Customization tab, the scroll down to Series > Data labels > Custom, and press Update.
![Display static point labels](images/05-chart/scatter-chart-custom-data-labels.png)
- Since the Google Sheets scatter chart is not ideal, consider using the 3-column bubble chart below, or the [Scatter Chart with Tableau Public tutorial](scatter-chart-tableau) in this book.

#### Bubble chart with 3 columns {-}
Best to show the relationship between two series of data, similar to the scatter chart above, with labels in tooltips.

**Try it:** This bubble chart shows the same data as above on fertility and life expectancy. Float your cursor over each bubble to reveal a tooltip with the country name and the two data points.

<p><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CL7joH_3wvMYo9HIiSuFP0Ykv_Nl5DK6DYYcd3_gFnU/pubchart?oid=2105121864&amp;format=interactive"></iframe><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CL7joH_3wvMYo9HIiSuFP0Ykv_Nl5DK6DYYcd3_gFnU/edit#gid=1602534273">View source data from World Bank</a></p>

**Tutorial:**
- Begin by opening this link a new tab: [Google Sheets Bubble chart with 3 columns template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CL7joH_3wvMYo9HIiSuFP0Ykv_Nl5DK6DYYcd3_gFnU/)
- Format your data in a similar way as shown below, with three columns in this order:
  - A: label for each bubble
  - B: numeric data on horizontal x-axis
  - C: numeric data on vertical y-axis<br>
![Bubble chart with 3 columns data table](images/05-chart/bubble-chart-3-column-data.png)
- Follow most of the same steps in the first tutorial above.
- In the Chart Editor, skip the Recommendation tab, select the Chart Types tab, then choose Bubble chart (near Scatter chart).<br>
![Bubble chart types menu](images/05-chart/bubble-chart-types.png)
- Labels will appear on each bubble by default. To hide labels initially, so that they appear only in the interactive tooltips when floating the cursor over data, customize your chart. Click the editing controls in the upper-right corner, scroll down to Series, and change Labels > Color > None.<br>
![Hide labels in Google Sheets bubble chart](images/05-chart/bubble-chart-hide-labels.png)
- Unfortunately, there is no easy way to reduce all bubbles to a uniformly smaller size. See the Google Sheets Bubble chart with 5 columns below, or create a [Scatter Chart with Tableau Public](chart.html#scatter-chart-with-tableau-public) in this book.

#### Bubble chart with 5 columns {-}
Best to show the relationship between three or four series of data. Similar to a scatter chart, but with bubble size and color to represent additional variables.

**Try it:** This bubble chart shows fertility and life expectancy for a subset of the nations above, with population (shown by bubble size) and region (shown by bubble color). Float your cursor over bubbles to view data details.

<p><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgBWYm9nTGlCuyqSwU3SDb7xk-SMSPgjfYq5iLqL0nQ/pubchart?oid=200651442&amp;format=interactive"></iframe><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgBWYm9nTGlCuyqSwU3SDb7xk-SMSPgjfYq5iLqL0nQ/edit#gid=1182154897">View data from World Bank</a></p>

1) Read the [Tableau Public tool review](tableau-public) in this book, then download and install the free application on a Mac or Windows computer from <http://public.tableau.com>. Requires a free account.

2) Click the link and Save to download the sample file to your computer: [ct-districts-income-grades-2009-13 in Excel format](data/ct-districts-income-grades-2009-13.xlsx).

3) Open the sample file to view three columns: district, median household income, and grade levels (above/below national average for 6th grade Math and English test scores). The Notes tab explains how this data is based on the work of Sean Reardon et al. at the [Stanford Education Data Archive](http://purl.stanford.edu/db586ns4974), Motoko Rich et al. at [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html), Andrew Ba Tran at [TrendCT](http://trendct.org/2016/05/06/wealth-and-grades-compare-connecticuts-school-districts/), and the American Community Survey 2009-13 via [Social Explorer](http://socialexplorer.com).

Hint: To prepare your own scatter chart data from different sources, see the [Match Spreadsheet Columns with VLookup Function](vlookup) chapter in this book.

4) In Tableau Public, click Connect to import the data file from your computer. If you downloaded an Excel file, Connect to Excel. Or if you downloaded a CSV file, Connect to Text. Or click "More..." to connect to Google Sheets.

5) Drag the Data sheet into the Data Source field.

6) In bottom-left corner, below the "Go to Worksheet" reminder, click Sheet 1.

7) Welcome to the Tableau Public Worksheet. Although it may feel overwhelming at first, the key is learning where to drag items from the data tab into the main worksheet. Dimensions are any information that is qualitative or categorical, while measures are quantitative information about the dimensions.

8) Drag the Grade Levels measure into the Rows field.

9) Drag the Median Household Income measure into the Columns field. The initial chart will appear as one point, but that's because all of the data is aggregated together. We're not done yet.

10) Drag the District dimension into the lower portion of the Marks area. Now your scatter chart will appear, and float your cursor over each point to view details.

11) Click Sheet 1 to rename the title of your chart.

12) Click the Worksheet menu to Show Caption and type in data sources.

13) Recommended: Click the Standard menu (above Columns) to change view to Fit Width.

## Create Filtered Line Chart with Tableau Public {- #filtered-line-chart-tableau}
TODO: Decide whether to keep or not. Originally co-authored with Veronica. An interactive filtered line chart provides checkboxes to turn on/off selected data lines to make specific comparisons, since displaying all of the lines at once would be overwhelming. Readers can float their cursor over each line to identify the school name and data details. We created this tutorial to help a Hartford non-profit education advocacy group compare cohorts of student achievement levels over time across forty schools. You can create your own version with a free downloadable tool for Mac and Windows computers, Tableau Public <https://public.tableau.com>.

1) Read the [Tableau Public tool review](tableau-public) in this book, then download and install the free application on a Mac or Windows computer from <http://public.tableau.com>. Requires a free account.

2) Click link and Save file to download to your computer: [sample-filtered-line-chart in CSV format](data/sample-filtered-line-chart.csv). CSV means comma-separated values, a generic spreadsheet format that most data tools can easily open.

Hint: When preparing your own spreadsheet, format your data so that Tableau Public can read it. For example, make sure that Year data is entered as "2007" instead of "1/1/2007". Leave all blank spaces as-is so that Tableau automatically converts them to "null" values during the data import.

3) In Tableau Public, click Connect to import the data file you downloaded to your computer. If you downloaded a CSV file, Connect to Text. Or if you downloaded an Excel file, Connect to Excel. Or click "More..." to connect to Google Sheets.

4) Your data sheet should automatically appear in Tableau Public. Any blanks will automatically convert to “null.”

5) In bottom-left corner, below the "Go to Worksheet" reminder, click Sheet 1.

6) Welcome to the Tableau Public Worksheet. Although it may feel overwhelming at first, the key is learning where to drag-and-drop items from the data tab into the main worksheet. Dimensions are any information that is qualitative or categorical, while measures are quantitative information about the dimensions.  In this example, we are creating a line chart with two dimensions (year and school) and one measure (scores).

7) Drag-and-drop Year into the Column field.

8) Drag-and-drop Schools into the Row field.

9) Drag-and-drop Scores into the middle of the grid.

10) Select Score (but not its drop-down menu), then go to the Analysis menu and turn off Aggregated Measures. We need to do this so that the numbers are displayed individually, and not aggregated by default.

11) In the upper-right corner, go to the Show Me window. (If it is closed, then open it.) Then select Lines (continuous).

12) Initially, each School row appears at its own chart. To blend all of them together into one master chart, drag School to the Marks window and drop it on the Color button. All of the School lines will appear in one chart, with identifying colors.

13) To filter the line chart to display only selected items, go to the Marks window, select the School Cohort drop-down menu, and choose Filter.

14) The Filter window should appear in the far-right side. (If necessary, close the Show Me window to view the Filter window.) Select only a few schools to display by default.

15) Since users can identify schools by turning them on in the Filter window, or floating their cursors to view tooltips for each line, we do not need to show the color legend for each school. In bottom-right School window, select the drop-down menu and choose Hide Card.

16) Confirm or enter text for the axes, title, and caption to describe the data source.

17) To publish your chart on the public web, select File > Save to Tableau Public As. Requires signup for a free Tableau account.

18) Give your workbook a meaningful title, since this name will appear in the URL for your published work on the Tableau Public server, and Save.

19) After publishing your work on the web, Tableau Public will automatically open the web link in your default browser. Click Edit Details to enter more information. Under Toolbar settings, see checkbox to Allow your workbook and its data to be downloaded by others.
