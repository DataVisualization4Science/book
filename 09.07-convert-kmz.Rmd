## Convert a Compressed KMZ file to KML format {#convert-kmz}
*By [Jack Dougherty](author), last updated March 17, 2016*

Sometimes KML files are distributed in compressed KMZ format. One easy conversion method:

- Install the free [Google Earth tool](https://www.google.com/earth/)
- Double-click on any .kmz file to open it in Google Earth
- Right-click (or control-click) on the .kmz layer and select *Save As*

- Use the *Save As* drop down menu to select .kml format

Or use any zip-utility and simply unzip the kmz file. Kmz is simply a 'zipped' version of a kml file!
