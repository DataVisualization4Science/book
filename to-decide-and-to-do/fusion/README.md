# Google Fusion Tables

**TO DO - explain how Fusion Tables is no longer an actively-developed tool, in the opinion of the author and several other former users. As a result, this part of the book will be archived and no longer updated**

- Full-screen responsive web design works on most devices
- Searchable location with filters (checkboxes, sliders, etc.)
- Optional template to embed as an iframe on your own site
- All data (up to 100,000 map points) resides in Google Fusion Table
- Post questions on [Google Group Forum for this template](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fusion-table-map-template)
