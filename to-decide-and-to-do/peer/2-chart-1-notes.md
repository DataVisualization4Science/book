## Evaluate:
1. Story: Did the author clearly tell a meaningful story about the data, with text and visuals?
  - No, this simple statement that students come from “several different countries” is not a very meaningful story.
2. Chart Type: Did the author choose a chart type that best matches their data story?
  - No. Although a vertical column chart is a good start, a horizontal bar chart would be a better match for these long labels.
3. Embed: Did the author embed an interactive chart into the web page?
  -  No, when you try to float your cursor over the chart, it is a static image, not an interactive visualization.
4. Good Design: Did the author follow principles of good chart design?
  -  No, the chart ignores several design principles, such as:
    - Failure to sort data into a meaningful order
    - Failure to declutter the chart by removing the unnecessary legend
