Do you feel overwhelmed by the enormous range of data visualization tools? There's been so many different tools released in recent years that anyone would have a hard time deciding which ones to use. Even if you limit your choices to the dozen or so tools specifically mentioned in this book, how do you make wise decisions?

- [Draw and Write Your Data Story](draw) reminds us to start with the most important item in your toolkit: ***your story***. Begin by drawing pictures and writing questions or sentences to capture your ideas on paper, and then choose the most appropriate tools to create your vision.
- [Ask Questions When Choosing Tools](ask) lists several criteria to consider when making software decisions. Many of us look for free or affordable tools in the perfect sweet spot---easy-to-learn, yet powerful---and that's the focus of this book.
- [Rate Three Simple Map Tools](rate) invites readers to create a basic interactive point map using three different online tools, and to evaluate each one using selected criteria from the chapter above.
