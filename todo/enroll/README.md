This free six-week course is ideal for non-profit organizations, small business owners, local governments, journalists, academics, or anyone who wants to tell their story and show the data.

We’ll begin with easy-to-learn tools, then gradually work our way up to editing open-source code templates with GitHub. Together, we’ll follow step-by-step tutorials with video screencasts, and share our work for feedback on the web. Real-world examples are drawn from Trinity College students working with community organizations in the City of Hartford, Connecticut.

Tutorials will feature tools such as Google Sheets, Tableau Public, Carto, Highcharts, Leaflet, and GitHub in the browser.

## What you’ll learn:
- Choose the right tools to tell your story
- Create and embed charts on your site
- Design maps and detect bias
- Share, edit, and host code templates
- Transform your map data
- Tell your story and show the data
