#### Sort data by columns {-}

To sort data rows by a column, select the entire spreadsheet (top-left corner icon), then right-click or look for the sort menu. Be sure to select the entire sheet to avoid accidentally sorting one column without the adjacent ones.

```{r spreadsheet-sort}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("images/02-spreadsheet/SpreadsheetSort640w.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("images/placeholder.jpg")
```
