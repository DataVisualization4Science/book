** TO DO **

- rewrite into tool review and tutorial format
- place polygon conversion at top and specify import-export formats

Go to http://geojson.io to explore this open-source web tool to convert, edit, and create GeoJSON map data. The tool was originally developed by Tom MacWright, and is supported by Mapbox.com.

#### Convert a CSV spreadsheet of point data into GeoJSON {-}

Use any spreadsheet tool and prepare a list of coordinate points (known as features). You must include column headers **lat** and **lon**, or a fuller spelling, such as *latitude* and *longitude*. The order of the columns does not matter. Also, you can add more headers to identify each point (example: name) and include more details (known as the properties of the features).

Save your spreadsheet in generic CSV format. *Hint:* see [Save Spreadsheet as CSV chapter](csv) in this book.

Try it! Click this link and Save to download this sample file to your computer: [name-lat-lon-info in CSV format](data/name-lat-lon-info.csv). CSV means comma-separated values, a generic spreadsheet format that most data tools can easily open.

Drag the CSV file into the GeoJSON.io map window. Flip between the JSON and Table tabs to view or edit the data.

Select the Save menu and export into GeoJSON format.

Optional: Login to GeoJSON.io with your GitHub account and save directly to your repository.

#### Convert Shapefile or KML polygons into GeoJSON {-}
Polygon boundary data is often shared as ArcGIS Shapefiles (.shp) or Keyhole Markup Language (.kml) files. Drag any of these (and other) files into the <http://GeoJSON.io> map window. Flip between the JSON and Table tabs to view or edit the data.

Select the Save menu and export into GeoJSON format.

#### Create GeoJSON data with drawing tools {-}
Use the <http://GeoJSON.io> drawing tools to create points, polygons, and polylines. Flip between the JSON and Table tabs to view or edit the data.
