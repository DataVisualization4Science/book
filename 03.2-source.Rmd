## Source Your Data Files {#source}
*last updated March 1, 2017*

Source your data. Spell out exactly where it came from, so that someone other than you, several years in the future, could understand its origin.

#### Label the file name {-}

Everyone has seen examples of bad file names:

  - data.xls
  - bldgdatalist.csv
  - data77.xls

Write a short but meaningful file name. It is a good idea to include data source in file name (eg `acs2018`, `worldbank`, or `eurostat`). If different versions of the data are floating around, add the current date at the end, in YYYY-MM-DD format. Good file names look like this:

  - town-demographics-2019-12-02.xls
  - census2010_population_by_county.csv
  - eurostat-1999-2019-CO2_emissions.xlsx

#### Save source data in separate sheet {-}

Before modifying the original dataset, make sure to duplicate it to avoid any data losses. One way is to click (or right-click) on the spreadsheet tab to copy the sheet to another tab as a backup.

```{r spreadsheet-copy-sheet}
if(knitr::is_html_output()) knitr::include_url("images/02-spreadsheet/SpreadsheetCopySheet640w.gif") else knitr::include_graphics("images/placeholder.jpg")
```

Add a *source* tab, after the data, with notes to remind you and others about its origins and when it was last updated.
