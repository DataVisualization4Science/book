## Polygon Map with Tableau Public {#tableau-polygon}
*by [Jack Dougherty](authors)last updated Monday January 27, 2020*

Tableau Public is freely-available software that contains powerful tools to quickly create interactive polygon maps for common boundaries (such as US States, or World Nations.) If you need to create customized maps for less-common boundaries, see our chapter on [Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets](leaflet-maps-with-google-sheets) in this volume.

Download and install theÂ free Tableau Public tool, available for Mac or Windows, at <https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download>. Do not confuse with other Tableau products that require payment. Installation may require up to 5-10 minutes. 

Important: Tableau Public is designed to publicly display your data, which makes this free tool very appropriate for educators, journalists, non-profit organizations, or other users who wish to openly share their map. If you desire a private tool to restrict your data, Tableau offers other tools that require payment.
