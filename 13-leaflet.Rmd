# Leaflet Map Templates {#leaflet}
*by [Ilya Ilyankou and Jack Dougherty](authors), last updated March 21, 2017*

While beginners appreciate the drag-and-drop map tools and tutorials described earlier in this book, such as [BatchGeo](batchgeo), [Google My Maps](mymaps) and [Carto](carto), more advanced users may wish to customize their visualizations, add more complex data and interactivity, and control exactly how and where their work appears on the web. A more powerful and relatively easy-to-learn solution is to use code templates built with Leaflet <https://leafletjs.com>, an open-source library, which you can [modify and host on GitHub](github), as described in this book.

#### Tool Review {-}
- Pros of working with Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com):
  - Open-source code, which anyone can freely use online, download, modify, or expand with plugins
  - Easier for beginners to understand than some other map code libraries
  - Compact code library (less than 40 KB) that runs on JavaScript in all modern web browsers
- Cons:
  - Must host your own code repositories to publish to the web (with a free service such as GitHub Pages)
  - Must rely on open-source community of developers to maintain the core code or specific plugins

| Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets<br> ![](images/12-leaflet/leaflet-maps-with-google-sheets.png) | Best to show points, polygons, polylines, or point table data. Upload your GeoJSON data and modify settings in linked Google Sheet (or CSV) and GitHub repo. <br>Template with tutorial: [Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets](leaflet-maps-with-google-sheets) |

#### Inside Leaflet code templates {-}
The templates featured below vary from simple to complex, but all of them include three basic types of code:

- HTML: to structure content on the web (example: index.html)
- CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet: to shape how content appears on the web (example: style.css)
- JavaScript: to create the map and interactivity  (example: script.js)

Also, these templates refer to other types of code:

- library: link to online instructions to complete routine tasks (examples: Leaflet, jQuery)
- basemap tiles: link to online background map (example: Carto Positron, a light-gray street map)
- data: content to appear on map, typically in CSV or GeoJSON format (examples: data.csv, data.geojson)
