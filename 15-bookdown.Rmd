# Publishing with Bookdown {#bookdown}
*by [Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou](authors), last updated February 13, 2019*

This open-access book is published using open-source tools, featuring Bookdown with RStudio and GitHub. Publishing with Bookdown allows authors to compose in Markdown (an easy-to-read-and-write computer syntax that works on multiple platforms) and publish in multiple formats (static HTML web pages, PDF files, ePUB ebooks, Microsoft Word documents). Hosting the book in a public GitHub repository, and publishing it with GitHub Pages, easily makes the original text of the book, as well as the published products, available on the public web. For a technical guide to publishing with Bookdown, see Yihui Xie, *Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown*, 2018, <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/>.

#### Setup RStudio, Bookdown, and TinyTeX {-}
Below are steps we followed to setup the publishing platform for this book, using our Macintosh OS 10.14 computers. The same general principles also should apply to Windows computers. No special knowledge is required, but these steps will be easier if users are adventurous or already familiar with R Studio, GitHub, or editing code.

- Install R Project statistical programming language <https://www.r-project.org> to build your book with Bookdown. (Yes, we too were surprised to use a statistics package to publish a book, but it works!). [See screenshot](images/15-bookdown/1-r-download.png)
- Install the free RStudio Desktop to make R easier to use with a visual editor. [See screenshot](images/15-bookdown/2-download-rstudio.png)
- Inside RStudio, select the Packages tab, and select Install. [See screenshot](images/15-bookdown/3-packages-install.png)
- Inside RStudio, install the "bookdown" package to build your book, and select Install Dependencies. [See screenshot](images/15-bookdown/4-install-bookdown.png)
- Bookdown now should be successfully installed in RStudio. [See screenshot](images/15-bookdown/5-installed.png)
- Inside RStudio, install the "tinytex" package for Bookdown to create a PDF edition of your book. [See screenshot](images/15-bookdown/6-install-tinytex.png)
- Don't forget: in RStudio console, type `tinytex::install_tinytex()` and press return to finish the installation. [See screenshot](images/15-bookdown/7-finish-install-tinytex.png)
- Note: In the step above, we received this error message on our Mac computers: `/usr/local/bin not writeable`. We resolved by reading the software developer's GitHub issue <https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/24> and following these steps:
  - In the Mac Applications > Utilities folder, open the Terminal application.
  - Carefully type `sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin` and press return.
  - Carefully type (without "sudo") `~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr path add` and press return.
  - Close the Terminal application.
  - In the RStudio console, type `tinytex::install_tinytex(force = TRUE)` and press return.

#### Download and Build a Sample Book {-}
- Create a free GitHub account <https://github.com> to share code repositories and publish book editions online.
- In your web browser, log into your GitHub account, go to the software developer's bookdown-minimal repo <https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-minimal>, and fork a copy to your GitHub account. To learn about forking in GitHub, see this chapter <http://datavizforall.org/github.html> in this book.
- Install GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com> to transfer files between your online GitHub repo and local computer
- In your web browser, go to your forked copy of `bookdown-minimal` and click the green `Clone or Download` button and select `Open in Desktop`. This should automatically open the GitHub Desktop application, and you can navigate to copy the code repo to a folder on your local computer.
- In RStudio in the upper-right corner, select Project > Open Project to open the `bookdown-minimal` folder on your local computer. [See screenshot: Open project](images/15-bookdown/8-project-open.png)
- In RStudio, open the `index.Rmd` file and make some simple edits to the text of this minimal book. For example, remove the hashtag `#` comment symbol in line 8 to "uncomment" and activate the PDF book option. Save your edits. [See screenshot: Edit the index.Rmd file](images/15-bookdown/9-edit-book.png)
- Optional: Use your preferred text editor, such as Atom editor <https://atom.io>, to modify the text.
- In RStudio, upper-right corner, select the Build tab, select Build Book, and choose All Formats to build both the gitbook-style static web edition and PDF edition.
- If RStudio successfully builds both editions of your minimal book, the output will be saved into your `bookdown-minimal` folder, in a subfolder named `_book`, because that's how this sample is configured. The RStudio internal browser should automatically open your web edition (and it's not a very good browser, so feel free to close it). Also, open the subfolder and inspect the PDF edition. If RStudio found any errors, they will appear in the Build viewer. [See screenshot: Successful build](images/15-bookdown/11-successful-build.png)
- Hint: In future sessions with RStudio, you may need to select Packages tab and click Update to keep bookdown and other software packages up to date. [See screenshot: Update packages](images/15-bookdown/12-packages-update.png)
- Close RStudio.

#### Publish your Book with GitHub Pages {-}
- Open GitHub Desktop and navigate to the `bookdown-minimal` folder on your local computer. Write a summary to commit (save) the changes you made above to your master branch, and push this version to your online GitHub repo.
- In your web browser, go to your online GitHub repo, with a web address similar to `https://github.com/USERNAME/bookdown-minimal` (insert your GitHub username).
- In your GitHub repo, select Settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section (which is a free web hosting service to publish your code and book editions on the public web). Select Master Branch as your source, and Save.
- Scroll down to this section again, and the web address of your published site should appear. Copy this address.
- In a new browser tab, paste the web address from above, and at the end add `_book/index.html` because this sample is configured to store the web edition of your book in this subfolder. Your web address should be similar to: `https://USERNAME.github.io/bookdown-minimal/_book/index.html`

#### Customize your Bookdown and GitHub settings {-}
- To see customized settings for this book, go to its online repository <https://github.com/datavizforall/dataviz-bookdown>
- In the `_bookdown.yml` file, the output directory is set to build all book formats into the `docs` folder.
- The GitHub Pages settings for this repo (which you cannot view) is set to publish from the `master/docs` folder, to match the output directory above. This simplifies the published web address to this format: `https://USERNAME.github.com/REPONAME`
- Most of the Bookdown configuration settings appear in the `index.Rmd` file. Read more about these options in the software developer's technical guide, <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/>.
- In addition, this GitHub Pages repo is published with a custom domain name <https://DataVizForAll.org>. Learn more about custom domain names at <https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/>, which requires purchasing a domain name from a web hosting service (such as <http://ReclaimHosting.com>). Adding a GitHub Pages custom domain name creates an additional `CNAME` file in the `docs` subfolder. Be careful not to delete it (or place a copy in a subfolder for safekeeping).
- This book also includes a custom `404.html` file that was manually transferred into the `docs` subfolder, since it is not automatically built by Bookdown.
- This book also includes a custom `google-analytics-datavizforall.html` file in the root-level of repo (where bookdown looks for it) and also is manually transferred to the `docs` subfolder (since bookdown does *not appear* to copy it to there on each build). This tracks web traffic with Google Analytics.

#### Bookdown-flavored Markdown: Syntax and Style Guide {-}

##### Links with brackets and parentheses {-}
Use brackets and parentheses for an [embedded link](http://example.com)

Use parentheses only for a non-embedded link (http://example.com)

Similarly, display URL with angle brackets: <http://example.com>

If necessary, use HTML to create <a href='http://example.com/'>link that opens in a new page</a>

##### Headers with Cross-Reference Links {-}

This DataVizForAll book, each chapter and section is a separate .Rmd file. The numerical order of the file names (index.Rmd, 0.1-x.Rmd, 0.2-y.Rmd, 01-z.Rmd, etc) determines the sequence that they will appear in the built book.

In the index.Rmd file, the settings for the web book state that each chapter and section will be split into its own HTML page, with no automatic numbering.

```markdown
split_by: section
number_sections: false
```

Chapters begin with a first-level header (one hashtag: #) and sections begin with a second-level header (two hashtags: ##). Both chapter and section titles are immediately followed by short ID in curly brackets to enable easy cross-reference links inside the book. The short IDs **MUST** be unique, and ideally **SHOULD** match the .Rmd file name. Although each hashtag chapter/section title is the default ID (such as #Introduction in index.Rmd),  it's safer to create a unique short ID for each chapter/section to avoid confusion.

Bylines appear in italics at the top of each chapter or section, with an embedded cross-reference links to the authors page, followed by the last updated date.

Examples of chapter and section headers, with short IDs, bylines, and dates:

```markdown
# Chapter Title {#chapter}
*by [Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou](authors), last updated January 22, 2019*
```

```markdown
## Section Title {#section}
*by [Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou](authors), last updated January 22, 2019*
```

Subheadings inside the chapters/sections must begin with 4 hashtags and end with a no-numbering symbol `{-}`. Note: Using three hashtags makes the subheader appear in the TOC because I have not found way to control toc_depth in web output. Use the no-number symbol to prevent automatic numbering of subheaders (in case we switch the book settings from no-auto-numbering to auto-numbering in the future).

```markdown
#### Subheadings: use 4 hashtags and a no-number symbol {-}
```

To embed an internal cross-reference to any chapter or section in the book, embed a link with brackets [for the text] and parentheses (with the short ID). If the cross-ref appears in the body of the text, ADD THE PHRASE "in this book" to the end of the sentence to allow us to search/find all cross-refs in future if needed:

```markdown
See the [GitHub tutorial](github) in this book.
```
NOTE that cross-reference links above are designed for HOSTED WEB BOOKS, and may not work the same in local repo versions, or in ebook/PDF versions.

#### Bookdown-flavored Markdown Syntax {-}

For an em-dash, use three hyphens---like this---rather than two hyphens.

For a block quote, start each line with a caret **AND** add two spaces to insert a line break:

Code:
```Markdown
> I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me, I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet place and kill him.    
> --- Mark Twain  
> --- notable American author
```

Demo:
> I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me, I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet place and kill him.    
> --- Mark Twain  
> --- notable American author  

Simple footnote

Code:
```Markdown
A text-only footnote.^[This is a footnote, with no reference]
```
Demo:
A text-only footnote.^[This is a footnote, with no reference]

See On The Line book (http://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu) for more details about footnotes using Zotero and Better BibTeX.

#### Embed images and iframes {-}

Insert image using Markdown syntax:

Code:
```Markdown
![Caption using markdown: auto-number does not appear in web, but appears in pdf, text *with italics*, no center-alignment on web, but centered in PDF, with [source link](https://google.com)](images/sample.jpg)
```
Demo:

![Caption using markdown: auto-number does not appear in web, but appears in pdf, text *with italics*, no center-alignment on web, but centered in PDF, with [source link](https://google.com)](images/sample.jpg)

#### Output in other formats {-}

This book is being built primarily for the web edition, and will require more work to create formatted PDF and EPUB versions.

Add this later to index.Rmd, and correctly place and indent it

```markdown
      download: [pdf, epub, mobi, docx]
```

And also add this to index.Rmd, and correctly place and indent it

```markdown
bookdown::pdf_book: default

bookdown::epub_book:
  dev: svglite
  stylesheet: css/style.css

bookdown::word_document2:
  default
```
