## US and Census Bureau Open Data {#census}
*last updated March 1, 2017*

**The U.S. Census Bureau** (http://census.gov) collects and shares population, housing, and economic data on its open repositories.
- American FactFinder (http://factfinder.census.gov) provides quick facts for a specific location, or links to download more detailed datasets
- The Decennial Census is a full count of the population every ten years, most recently in 2010.
- The American Community Survey (ACS) (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) is annual sample count, which produces:
  - 1-year estimates for areas with populations of 65,000+
  - 3-year estimates for areas with populations of 20,000+
  - 5-year estimates for all census areas

Census areas are geographic divisions in this *general format*:
- State
- County
- County subdivisions (equivalent to Connecticut towns and cities)
- Census tracts (designated areas, roughly 2,500 to 8,000 people)
- Block groups (sub-unit of tract, roughly 600 to 3,000 people)
- Census blocks (sub-unit of block group, but not always a city block)

Common census areas, as shown in [American FactFinder download tool](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml).
